  <h2>About My Art</h2>
  <p>
    Art has always been my way of expressing emotions, ideas, and creativity. From sketching and painting to digital artwork,
    I love exploring different styles and techniques.
  </p>
  <p>
    My artwork often reflects my mood, surroundings, and imagination. Each piece I create is a part of my journey — colorful, personal, and full of passion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether it's traditional mediums or experimenting with digital tools, I enjoy bringing my thoughts to life through art. It's more than a hobby — it's my therapy, my voice, and my inspiration.
